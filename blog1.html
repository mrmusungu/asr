						<p>Q: What is ecodriving and how beneficial can it be to our region?
Ecodriving is a set of steps, techniques and behaviours that drivers can employ in preparation of the vehicle before a journey. This includes planning the journey, modifying driving style during the journey and in reviewing trip data after the journey, that can, taken together, lead to savings (at times, significant ones) in terms of fuel usage, trip cost, emissions of CO2 and other pollution, and levels of noise from vehicle use.
Therefore, Ecodriving is a term used to describe energy efficient use of vehicles. It is a great and easy way to reduce fuel consumption from road transport so that less fuel is used to travel the same distance.
Ecodriving techniques are both beneficial to the driver and to the region in the sense that an Ecodriver will burn less fuel, meaning less emissions, will travel more for less fuel, will save money and be a safe driver, with less or no incidents and accidents.
These savings can be realised for relatively low cost compared to other kinds of efforts to reduce the environmental impacts of car use. In addition, trips made with Ecodriving techniques can, in many cases, be linked to improved road safety; moreover, the use of such techniques does not increase journey times.

Q: How successful is the 'Green Freight Program' along the Northern Corridor, developed in 2016 to minimise health, safety and environmental impacts of freight movement?
Since the Northern Corridor Member States embarked on a long journey of integrating Sustainable Freight Transport (SFT) components namely, social, economic and environmental aspects in all infrastructure projects and trade facilitation and Transport Logistics initiatives, the Corridor registered some progress especially on the component of Green Freight transport by cutting down Port and Road transport emissions such as Particulate Matter (PM), black carbon emissions and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) and CO2 emission in grams per ton-km.
In 2011, the whole East African Region Harmonized Fuel Standards. The Northern Corridor region specified that diesel should have a maximum sulphur content of 50 parts per million (ppm), while petrol should have an octane rating of 93.
Prior to 2011, the sulphur levels found in diesel in the East African region ranged between 5,000 parts per million (ppm) and 10,000 ppm, compared to that in developed countries (US and Europe) standards of 10-15 ppm.
The reduction of Greenhouse Gas emissions and pollution is critical, especially when it comes to investment in low emission approaches to fight Climate Change which requires appropriate attention.
The value of the logistics sector in East Africa is estimated at 15 to 25 billion USD per annum. The East African economies are growing rapidly and therefore increasing the transport industry at the same pace. Consequently, the freight transport sectors are one of the fastest growing sources of Greenhouse Gas emissions and pollution at national and regional levels.
In the Northern Corridor, the top 10 routes having maximum Greenhouse Gas emissions are Mombasa-Malaba, Mombasa-Nairobi, Mombasa-Busia, Nairobi-Busia, Busitema-Kampala, Luwero-Elegu, Luwero-Goli, Mbale-Goli, Mubende- Kasindi and Mbale-Elegu. Out of 25 routes in Northern Corridor, these 10 routes constituted 86 % of estimated total Greenhouse Gas emissions of the corridor.   Hence these routes are priority routes were climate change mitigation actions can be identified and implemented for reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions in the corridor.
Recent findings of Greenhouses Gas emissions revealed that, the estimated total Greenhouse Gas emissions of Northern Corridor are 1.73 Million Metric tons of Carbon dioxide equivalent, out of which Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) emissions account for about 98.75 per cent; followed by Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions and Methane (CH₄) emissions are comparatively very small. Hence, the Climate Change Mitigation measures to be planned for the Northern Corridor region require to focus mainly on reducing Carbon Dioxide emissions.
In the Northern Corridor region, the onward journey (from Mombasa to hinterlands) constituted 58% (1 MMtCO₂e) of estimated total Greenhouses Gas emissions and return journey constituted 42% (0.73MMtCO₂e) of the estimated total Greenhouses Gas emissions.
In the return journey, the empty trips contributed 59% (0.43MMtCO₂e) of the estimated total Greenhouses Gas emissions of the return journey, and loaded trips contributed 41% (0.30MMtCO₂e) of the total Greenhouses Gas emission of the return journey.
<br><br>
Q: The Northern Corridor Secretariat prepared a baseline for the Port of Mombasa in 2017 and that of the corridor in 2018. Are you satisfied with collaboration from the Member States in ensuring all activities agreed upon in the validation exercise are implemented?
The Northern Corridor holistic Sustainable Freight Transport Programme comes in line with the global and continental frameworks such as the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, Agenda 2063 of the African Union, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-which provide a supportive backdrop for adopting and following through on green economy initiatives.
The Northern Corridor secretariat was and always is committed to collecting data on a regular basis on the Green Freight indicators to be featured in the Northern Corridor Transport Observatory reports on annual basis. So far, relevant stakeholders in the Northern Corridor Member States are on the right track in providing data and different initiatives have been put in place to mitigate the challenges to achieve a Sustainable Freight Transport in the region.
<br><br>
Q: Which Member States are excelling in this aspect and which ones are dropping the ball?
All the Northern Corridor Member States have put in place mechanisms and programmes that are in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, Agenda 2063 of the African Union, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including the Northern Corridor Sustainable Freight Transport Programme.
<br><br>
Q: How  has been the on going surveys and maping of black spots along the northern corridor?
In implementing its Strategic Plan 2017-2021, especially under its strategic objectives NUMBER2 related to improving safety in all modes of transport, the Northern Corridor Secretariat has carried out black spots mapping and Road surveys in all the six Member States.
Those included Black Spots identification, Data Collection and Analysis, Development of countermeasures, implementation of the measure at Black spots locations and Evaluation of the countermeasures.
Surveys observations and findings generally revealed the following:

Over speeding and Overtaking.
There is tendency of vehicles to over speed and overtake dangerously with risk of Head-on, Rear-end, Side-impact, Side-swipe, roll-over, Multi-vehicle pile-ups collisions. This therfore calls
for sensitization programs and Driver training on defensive driving.

Narrow roads, missing/non existence of road signages
Most of the surveyed road sections are narrow in some Member countries. They don't meet the standards recommended by the EAC study on Transport Facilitation in the Region. In addition, there is lack of critical road signs along the road while other road signs are obscured / blocked by trees.

Lack of designated pedestrian crossing points and Non Motorised Transport facilities
Lack of marked pedestrian crossings and walkways are forcing pedestrian to cross anywhere and walk on road edge oblivious of their safety.

Dangerous sharp curves combined with steep slopes
In Countries with hilly landscape, most roads upcountry present dangerous curves which are combined with steep slops. This leads to vehicles skidding and overturning.

Slippery road pavement and frog during rainy season
The nature of terrain described above impacts on the construction of roads  with steep slopes. As consequence, during the rainy season roads are slippery and foggy with less visibility.

Unsafe junction/access layout
Major junctions are not channelized with road marking. There is no-existence of road marking thereby confusing road users in addition to junctions located on horizontal/vertical curves with limited visibility splay.

Obstruction by trucks, PSV parking by road side
Some trucks are parked on shoulders due to lack of designated parkings. Heavy truck parking space not provided within traversed town centers. PSVs pick and drop on road edges. The expediting of RSS will come up as one of the key recommendations.

Vendors selling their wares by the road side/ Encroachment into road reserve
There exist many makeshift kiosks by the road side in town/market centers traversed by the road, and vendors have turned temporary bus bays into market spaces.

Damaged/missing guardrails and handrails at major bridges
Guardrails are damaged  and several pieces of handrails are missing on bridge crossing exposing pedestrians and cyclists to great danger. In addition roads are narrowed to accommodate the width of the bridges.
